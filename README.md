## Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alejandro, I'm from Colombia and I'm an electronic engineer passionate about data, ML, and software with a master in engineering.

* ðŸ”­ Currently working for Mercado libre as **Machine learning engineer**,
  
* Worked in CIAT as **data scientist** and research associate in [tumaini app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ciat.cgiar.org.tumaini&hl=en&gl=US) an android app for disease detection using tensorflow and their object detection API

* ðŸŒ± Honored Master Thesis: "BananaGAN: Augmenting major banana disease classification using generated diseased pseudostem and rachis images". I used generative adversarial networks to generate artificial banana sick plants images to do data augmentation as input to train object detection deep learning models

## Skills

* Python, SQL, ML and DL, TensorFlow, SciKit-Learn, Pandas
* Some basics and learning in Docker, AWS, PowerBI  
* Interested in Backend and web development

## Publications

* [AI-powered banana diseases and pest detection](https://plantmethods.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13007-019-0475-z)
* [Detection of banana plants and their major diseases through aerial images and machine learning methods: A case study in DR Congo and Republic of Benin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271620302410)

## Speaker in:

* International seminar new sensor technology for field phenotyping and precision agriculture 2021: "BananaGAN: Augmenting major banana disease
classification using generated diseased images"
* Pycon Colombia 2020: " Tumaini: A deep learning object detection API integrated to an android app, case of study in banana disease detection"
* 5TH international conference on mitigation strategies for emerging infectious diseases 2019: "Artificial intelligenc-Powered disease detection"
* 1st IEEE Signal Processing Society Winter School on Image and Video Analysis 2018: "Cassava modeling using machine learning models"
